# ACNH-Villagers

This is a simple front end project in which I have created a React TypeScript app that uses the Animal Crossing New Horizons RESTful API from http://acnhapi.com/ to obtain villagers data. The user input is a button where it randomly selects a villager from the API and displays its information. I have made use of Material UI and used Github for source control. 

To run the app, go to `my-app` and start using the `npm start` command.
